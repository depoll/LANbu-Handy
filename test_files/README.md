Contains some 3mf files for use in testing, downloaded from Makerworld.

## Test Files

- `multicolor-test-coin.3mf` - Single plate multicolor model for basic filament testing
- `multiplate-test.3mf` - Original 7-plate model where all plates use all 4 filaments
- `realistic-multiplate-test.3mf` - 5-plate model with different filament requirements per plate:
  - Plate 1: 1 filament (PLA only)
  - Plate 2: 2 filaments (PLA + PETG)
  - Plate 3: 3 filaments (PLA + ABS + TPU)
  - Plate 4: 1 filament (PETG only)
  - Plate 5: 4 filaments (All types)
- `Original3DBenchy3Dprintconceptsnormel.3mf` - Single plate test model

The `realistic-multiplate-test.3mf` file is specifically designed to test plate-specific filament filtering functionality.
