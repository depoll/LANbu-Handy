# LANbu Handy

A self-hosted Progressive Web Application (PWA) that enables users to slice 3D model files and send them to Bambu Lab printers operating in LAN-only mode. LANbu Handy restores core Bambu Handy app functionality for users who prefer or require their printers to operate without cloud connectivity.

## Overview

LANbu Handy provides a streamlined workflow from model URL to print initiation, all within your local network:

1. **Input Model URL**: Provide a URL to your 3D model (`.3mf` or `.stl` files)
2. **Download & Prepare**: The system downloads and validates the model file
3. **Configure Settings**: Map AMS filaments, select build plate, and configure slicing parameters
4. **Local Slicing**: Uses embedded Bambu Studio CLI for reliable, up-to-date slicing
5. **Print Initiation**: Sends the sliced G-code directly to your Bambu Lab printer via LAN

## Key Features

- üîó **URL to Print**: Provide a URL to your 3D model and start printing
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Local Slicing**: Uses embedded Bambu Studio CLI for reliable slicing
- üè† **LAN Only**: Operates entirely within your local network (post-download)
- üì± **Mobile-First**: Responsive PWA interface optimized for mobile devices
- üé® **AMS Integration**: Query AMS status and map filaments to model requirements
- üèóÔ∏è **Build Plate Selection**: Choose the correct build plate for optimal adhesion

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Bambu Lab printer in LAN-only mode
- Printer access code (found in printer settings)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/depoll/LANbu-Handy.git
   cd LANbu-Handy
   ```

2. **Configure your printer(s)**:

   Create a `.env` file or set environment variables:

   **For a single printer (legacy format)**:

   ```bash
   BAMBU_PRINTER_IP=192.168.1.100
   BAMBU_PRINTER_ACCESS_CODE=12345678
   ```

   **For multiple printers (recommended)**:

   ```bash
   BAMBU_PRINTERS=[{"name":"Living Room X1C","ip":"192.168.1.100","access_code":"12345678"},{"name":"Garage A1 mini","ip":"192.168.1.101","access_code":"87654321"}]
   ```

3. **Start the application**:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the PWA**:
   Open your mobile browser and navigate to `http://[your-server-ip]:8080`

### Usage

1. **Enter Model URL**: Provide a direct URL to your 3D model file (`.3mf` or `.stl` format)
   - Supported sources: GitHub releases, file sharing services, direct HTTP/HTTPS links
   - Model files should be publicly accessible without authentication

2. **Select Printer**: Choose your target printer from the dropdown (if multiple configured)
   - The interface will show printer status and availability
   - Printer must be powered on and connected to your network

3. **Configure AMS Filaments**: Review and map AMS filaments to model requirements
   - The system queries your printer's current AMS status
   - Map each model color/material requirement to available AMS slots
   - Override material types if needed (PLA, PETG, ABS, etc.)

4. **Choose Build Plate**: Select the appropriate build plate for your material
   - Cool Plate: PLA, PETG
   - Engineering Plate: ABS, ASA, PC
   - High Temp Plate: PA, PEI
   - Textured PEI Plate: PETG, TPU

5. **Slice Model**: Click "Slice" to process the model with Bambu Studio CLI
   - Monitor slicing progress in the interface
   - Review estimated print time and material usage
   - Slicing respects embedded `.3mf` settings with selective overrides

6. **Start Print**: Click "Print" to transfer G-code and start the print job
   - G-code is transferred via FTP to your printer
   - Print job starts automatically once transfer completes
   - Monitor initial print status in the interface

## Troubleshooting

### Container and Installation Issues

**Container won't start:**
```bash
# Check container logs
docker compose logs lanbuhandy

# Check if port 8080 is already in use
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :8080
# or on macOS:
lsof -i :8080

# If port is in use, modify docker-compose.yml to use different port:
# ports:
#   - '8081:8000'  # Change 8080 to 8081
```

**Permission issues with Docker:**
```bash
# Add user to docker group (Linux)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in, or:
newgrp docker

# Or run with sudo
sudo docker compose up -d
```

**Build failures:**
```bash
# Clean build (removes cached layers)
docker compose build --no-cache

# Check disk space
df -h

# Update Docker and Docker Compose to latest versions
```

### Printer Connection Issues

**Printer not detected or "Connection failed":**

1. **Verify LAN-only mode is enabled:**
   - Go to printer Settings ‚Üí Network ‚Üí LAN-Only Mode
   - Enable LAN-Only Mode and note the Access Code

2. **Check network connectivity:**
   ```bash
   # Test if printer IP is reachable
   ping 192.168.1.100  # Replace with your printer IP
   
   # Test MQTT port (8883 for secure, 1883 for non-secure)
   telnet 192.168.1.100 8883
   
   # Test FTP port  
   telnet 192.168.1.100 990
   ```

3. **Verify configuration:**
   - Double-check printer IP address in your `.env` file
   - Verify Access Code is exactly as shown on printer screen (8 digits)
   - Ensure no extra spaces or characters in configuration

4. **Multiple printers configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Correct JSON format for multiple printers:
   BAMBU_PRINTERS=[{"name":"Printer 1","ip":"192.168.1.100","access_code":"12345678"},{"name":"Printer 2","ip":"192.168.1.101","access_code":"87654321"}]
   
   # Common mistakes:
   # - Missing quotes around strings
   # - Extra commas at the end
   # - Spaces in JSON keys
   ```

**MQTT connection timeouts:**
- Some routers block MQTT traffic - check firewall settings
- Try power cycling the printer
- Verify printer firmware is up to date

### Model Download and File Issues

**"Failed to download model" errors:**

1. **URL format issues:**
   ```bash
   # ‚úÖ Correct: Direct file URLs
   https://github.com/user/repo/releases/download/v1.0/model.3mf
   https://example.com/files/model.stl
   
   # ‚ùå Incorrect: Repository or webpage URLs  
   https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/model.3mf
   https://thingiverse.com/thing/123456
   ```

2. **Authentication required:**
   - Ensure URLs are publicly accessible
   - For GitHub, use "releases" URLs, not repository file URLs
   - Test URL in browser's private/incognito mode

3. **File format issues:**
   ```bash
   # Supported formats:
   .3mf  # Preferred - includes print settings
   .stl  # Supported - requires manual configuration
   
   # Unsupported formats:
   .obj, .ply, .amf, .zip archives
   ```

**Large file downloads:**
- Files over 100MB may timeout - check your network connection
- Consider hosting files on faster CDN if possible

### Slicing Issues

**Bambu Studio CLI errors:**

1. **"Command not found" or CLI missing:**
   ```bash
   # Rebuild container to reinstall CLI
   docker compose down
   docker compose build --no-cache
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Slicing fails with memory errors:**
   - Increase Docker memory allocation to at least 4GB
   - For complex models, allocate 8GB+ RAM to Docker

3. **Invalid model errors:**
   ```bash
   # Common model issues:
   # - Non-manifold geometry
   # - Corrupt STL files  
   # - Models with zero volume
   
   # Try repairing model in:
   # - Meshmixer (free)
   # - Netfabb (Windows built-in)
   # - Online repair services
   ```

**Slicing configuration problems:**
- `.3mf` files contain embedded settings - these are preserved during slicing
- Manual overrides (filament, plate type) take precedence over embedded settings
- Check material compatibility with selected build plate

### PWA and Interface Issues

**Can't access web interface:**

1. **Check container status:**
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   # Should show lanbuhandy as "Up"
   
   docker compose logs lanbuhandy
   # Look for "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000"
   ```

2. **Network access:**
   ```bash
   # Try different URLs:
   http://localhost:8080        # If running on same machine
   http://192.168.1.50:8080    # Replace with your server IP
   http://<hostname>:8080       # Using hostname
   ```

3. **Firewall issues:**
   ```bash
   # Linux: Allow port 8080
   sudo ufw allow 8080
   
   # Check if firewall is blocking:
   sudo iptables -L | grep 8080
   ```

**Mobile browser compatibility:**
- Use modern browsers: Chrome 80+, Safari 13+, Firefox 75+
- Enable JavaScript and cookies
- Try refreshing with Ctrl+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

**PWA installation issues:**
- Look for "Add to Home Screen" in browser menu
- Ensure HTTPS is not required (should work on local network with HTTP)
- Clear browser cache if PWA features aren't working

### Performance Issues

**Slow slicing:**
- Increase Docker CPU allocation
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Consider using simpler print profiles for testing

**Interface lag:**
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Disable browser extensions
- Check network latency to server

**High memory usage:**
- Restart container periodically: `docker compose restart lanbuhandy`
- Monitor with: `docker stats lanbuhandy`

### Getting Help

**Enable debug logging:**
```bash
# Add to your .env file or docker-compose.yml:
LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Restart container
docker compose restart lanbuhandy

# View detailed logs
docker compose logs -f lanbuhandy
```

**Collect diagnostic information:**
```bash
# System info
docker --version
docker compose version
uname -a

# Container status
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=50 lanbuhandy

# Network connectivity
ping <printer_ip>
traceroute <printer_ip>
```

**Common solutions checklist:**
- [ ] Printer is powered on and connected to network
- [ ] LAN-only mode is enabled with correct access code
- [ ] Docker container is running (`docker compose ps`)
- [ ] No firewall blocking ports 8080, 8883, 990
- [ ] Model URL is direct link to `.3mf` or `.stl` file
- [ ] Sufficient disk space and memory available
- [ ] Using supported browser with JavaScript enabled

### Code Formatting and Linting

LANbu Handy uses automated code formatting to maintain consistent code style across the project:

#### Python (Backend)

- **Black**: Code formatter with 88-character line length
- **isort**: Import sorting compatible with Black
- **flake8**: Linting with Black-compatible rules

#### JavaScript/TypeScript (PWA)

- **Prettier**: Code formatter for JS/TS/CSS/HTML/JSON/Markdown
- **ESLint**: Linting for TypeScript and React

#### Setup for Development

**DevContainer Users (Automatic Setup)**:
If you're using the devcontainer (VS Code or GitHub Codespaces), pre-commit hooks are **automatically configured** when the container starts. No manual setup required!

**Local Development Setup**:

1. **Quick setup** (one command):

   ```bash
   # Automated setup script
   ./scripts/setup-dev-environment.sh
   ```

2. **Manual setup**:

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd pwa && npm install

   # Install pre-commit hooks
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Manual formatting** (if not using pre-commit):

   ```bash
   # Format Python code
   python -m black backend/
   python -m isort --profile black backend/

   # Format PWA code
   cd pwa && npm run format
   ```

4. **Check formatting**:

   ```bash
   # Python
   python -m black --check backend/
   python -m isort --profile black --check-only backend/
   python -m flake8 backend/

   # PWA
   cd pwa && npm run format:check
   cd pwa && npm run lint
   ```

The pre-commit hooks will automatically format your code before each commit, reducing linting errors and maintaining consistent style. All formatting checks are also run in CI.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend && python -m pytest

# Frontend linting
cd pwa && npm run lint

# Full Docker build test
docker compose build
```
